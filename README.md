suri_editor
===========

This is a very clean and simple editor, written in javascript to generate dynamic HTML on webpages.


Usage
-----
Create a div to hold the editor
```html
<div id='editor-canvas'></div>
```
Then call the editor initializer on the div.
```javascript
$('#editor-canvas').editor()
```
- This editor depends on jQuery



To see how this works, clone this repo and run editor.html
